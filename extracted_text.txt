  
  
Dear Investor,
We at NSDL are continuously striving to keep your investments active and safe, and hence please bear with us when we give you
this gentle reminder on the nomination requirement.
As an account holder, you have the choice to either opt-in for nomination, where you nominate someone, or opt-out of nomination,
where you declare that you are not nominating anyone. Nomination is a crucial facility that ensures the smooth and hassle-free
transmission of securities to the nominee(s) with minimal documentation in the unfortunate event of the account holder's demise.
In case nomination details are displayed as ‘Not registered’ under the ‘know more about your accounts’ (given at the end of this
CAS), we kindly request you to click on the provided link below or access NSDL's online platform (https://eservices.nsdl.com/instademat-
kyc-nomination/#/login)  to opt-in for nomination. An audio-visual tutorial on Nomination is also available for your ready reference. You
can either scan the QR code series or click on the link below to view and understand the comprehensive features of nomination.

Please help us serve you better. Wishing you a very fruitful month ahead.
Yours Sincerely,
Vijay Chandok
Managing Director & CEO
